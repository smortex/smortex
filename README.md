Hi! My name is Romain Tartière, I am a _Free Software mercenary_.  I live in French Polynesia where I enjoy coconuts; I love things from the 70's (like [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) or the [Japanese hard-rock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rock#1970s_to_1980s:_Diversification)) and I am fond of mixology :tropical_drink:.

I contribute to Free / Libre / Open Source software on a daily basis, with contributions to dozens and dozens of pieces of software.  My activity bellow shows a part of it, but keep in mind that GitHub is not the only place where you can contribute to Free Software.

### Projects I am actively working on

* [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org), as a ports maintainer for [my own ports](https://portscout.freebsd.org/romain@freebsd.org.html) and the [puppet@ ones](https://portscout.freebsd.org/puppet@freebsd.org.html);
* [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), while I am not working _for_ Puppet, I have been using it for years and regularly contribute to the various components composing the Puppet Platform;
* [Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/), as a contributor for the dozens Puppet modules this organization maintain;
* [Choria](https://choria.io/), as a contributor for the continuation of what used to be Marionette Collective before it was dropped-off the Puppet Platform.

### Top languages

### Work with me

I am not actively looking for a job at the moment.  Yet, I am open to offers and willing to meet people for future opportunities.

Beside my main activity, I make sure to have spare time to work on side projects as a contractor.  My base rate is 30000 XPF/hour and decrease with volume.
Conditions apply (non-exhaustive list):

* You want to see specific terms in the contract?  You provide a template ahead of time;
* You want me to work on site?  You handle travel and accomodation;
  * …for an extended period of time?  Also plan some leisure;
* You only have an open-space?  Add 2500 XPF/hour;
* You have some kind of dress-code?  You provide the appropriate disguise in advance.
